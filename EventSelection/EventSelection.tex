\chapter{Event Selection}
\label{sec:Selection}

For the three leading leptons, we apply offline thresholds of 20, 15, 10\,\GeV. We find that with these thresholds, the trigger efficiency of trilepton events is close to 100\%.

Events with an opposite-sign lepton pair with mass below 12 GeV are vetoed to reduce background from low-mass resonances. Furthermore, we reject trilepton events with an OSSF pair below the \Z boson mass window when the trilepton mass is within the \Z mass window. This cuts away background from asymmetric photon conversions in $\Z \to \ell\ell^* \to \ell\ell\gamma$, where the photon converts into two additional leptons, one of which is lost.
