A search for type-III seesaw heavy fermion production has been performed in multilepton final states using \fullLumi of proton--proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, collected using the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. No significant discrepancies between the background prediction and the data have been observed. Comparing the data with the predictions, we set upper limits at the 95\,\% confidence level on the production cross section of the heavy fermion pairs. Assuming degenerate heavy fermion masses $m_\Sigma$ in the flavor-democratic scenario, we exclude previously unexplored regions of the signal model with heavy fermion particle masses below $m_\Sigma < 440\GeV$ (expected: 430\GeV).
