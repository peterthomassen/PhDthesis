\abstract{
A search for type-III seesaw signal in events with three or more electrons or muons is presented. The data sample corresponds to \fullLumi\ of integrated luminosity in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Since the signal populates channels with at least three leptons and diverse kinematic properties, the data is binned in exclusive channels. The primary selection is based on the number of leptons and the invariant mass of opposite-sign dilepton systems which helps discriminate the signal against the Standard Model background. The final optimization for the type-III seesaw signal is based on the sum of leptonic transerve momenta and missing transverse energy. Control samples in data are used to check the robustness of background evaluation techniques and to minimize the reliance on simulation. The observations are consistent with expectations from Standard Model processes. The results are used to exclude heavy fermions of the type-III seesaw model with masses below 430\GeV.}

\acknowledgements{
Many individuals and institutions have supported me during my Ph.\,D. studies and thesis writing. I would like to express my graditude especially to my supervisor Prof.~Sunil Somalwar whose advice and guidance were both extremely valuable and refreshing, and to the members of the research group that I have been part of, especially Dr.~Richard Gray, Dr.~Matt Walker, and Dr.~Halil Saka, as well as to my fellow graduate students Sanjay Arora, Christian Contreras-Campaña, Emmanuel Contreras-Campaña, Maximilian Heindl, Shruti Panwalkar, Patrick Zywicki for their helpful discussions, input, and distractions. Special thanks go to Prof.~Scott Thomas for his guidance on theoretical matters, to Ezio Torassa and Andrea Gozzelino for the collaboration on the seesaw model, and to my dear fellow student Elliot ``Tote'' Hughes.

My involvement with Rutgers University started initially with an exchange organized by Würzburg University. Financial support for the exchange was provided by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). Further funds, for travel purposes as well as generally, came from several scholarships of the Foundation of German Business (Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft, sdw), COLA support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), as well as from Rutgers University and Prof.~Somalwar's NSF grant.

This thesis contains material from previous publications of the author \cite{Thomassen2012,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-002}.
